Custom functions allow your app to create and process workflow steps that users can add in Workflow Builder. 

We recommend using custom functions as a replacement for the deprecated Workflow Steps from Apps.

A custom function requires two components:

* A function definition in the appâ€™s manifest
* A listener to handle the function execution event

Read more about custom functions in the API documentation.
